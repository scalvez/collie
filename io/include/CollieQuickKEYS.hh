/** \brief Smoothing tool based on work of Kyle Cranmer
    \ingroup util
    This class is a smoothing tool based on the work of Kyle Cranmer.  It implements
    the same basic algorithm as the KEYS package, but uses C and C++ instead
    of FORTRAN, and has no dependency on PAW.  The class is designed to be 
    mostly independant of CollieAnalLib, and should be removable as a single 
    package.  
	
	Features:
    1) reflection and rescaling for boundary purposes
    2) creation of histogram from smoothed distribution


This is a version of the same algorithm as in the original CollieKeys (now
obsolete).  However, it runs much quicker in most cases, for a small cost 
in accuracy.
